# UP-Schedule-Planer
This is a program created by a student in University of Portland to create a next semester schedule based on information about courses and sections available and display them ordered based on user preference

## Preference settings
a user can customize the following settings and weight the preferences
 * time of the day the first class starts
 * time of the day the last class ends
 * have a lunch break at a user-specified range of time
 * having specific instructors/professors
 * having classes clustered on certain days to create a easy day hard day schedule
 
## Code language
This program was originally written in c++, and it was later migrated to java to utilize its friendlier graphics. As such, there are some code that might seem a bit wierd. Most likely it's because the code was originally in c++.

## Note
This program (and this repo) is created for my educational and self-convenience purposes, so don't expect it to be too professional. Also, the reason why almost all of the attributes are public is because I haven't learned object oriented and information hiding yet when writing version 1. Since this is still a one-man project, I see no need to change it.
